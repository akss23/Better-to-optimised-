## 📈 Examples

- [Two Sum (Array)](arrays/two_sum.py):  
  Efficient hash map approach with O(n) time complexity.

- [Reverse a Linked List](linked_lists/reverse_linked_list.cpp):  
  Iterative and recursive solutions, both optimized for O(n) time.

- [Lowest Common Ancestor in BST (Tree)](trees/lowest_common_ancestor.py):  
  Optimized traversal with O(h) time, where h is tree height.
